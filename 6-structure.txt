A library in go is a single or a grouip of modules that dont include the package 'main'. The idea 
behind libraries is to create a reusable codebase that can serve different functionalities for a
personal project or even the whole community. A program that executes on the other hand, includes
the 'main' package and the 'main' function which determine the difference between an executable
and a library.
